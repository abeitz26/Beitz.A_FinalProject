# Change in Biogeochemical Compositon and the Affect on Diatoms in Southern Lake Baikal
# Alex Beitz

I compared how sulfate concentrations, a dramatic increase can be a marker for human industrial contamination, impacted diatom populations in Lake Baikal. I then compared so4 concentraion with each species to see if some were affected more than others, which they were. I also included other organic compounds and mineral concentrations which are essential to or produced by diatoms to see if those were a factor.
